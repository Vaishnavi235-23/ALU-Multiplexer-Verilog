# ALU / Multiplexer Design (Verilog)

## Description
This project implements a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) / 4:1 multiplexer
using Verilog HDL. The design is verified through simulation using a testbench.

## Features
- Arithmetic and/or logic operations
- Multiplexer-based selection
- Verilog testbench verification

## Files
- alu_mux.v : ALU / MUX design module
- alu_mux_tb.v : Testbench for verification

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- EDA Playground

## Simulation
The design was simulated and verified using EDA Playground.
